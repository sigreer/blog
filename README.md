# Simple Astro Blog ported to Directus

This is a fork of Cosmic CMS's Simple Astro Blog template, ported to Directus. To build this app, weâ€™re going to use the following technologies:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A React framework for production that makes it easy to spin up a full-stack application.
- [Directus](https://directus.io/) - A Headless CMS and composable data platform to easily create and deploy data-rich apps.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A performant utility-first CSS framework that can be composed directly in your markup.

## Getting started
